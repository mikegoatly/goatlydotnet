[Azure Mobile Services](http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/mobile/) is an pretty cool platform that I’ve only just started trying out\. Microsoft provide quick jumpstart projects for Windows Store\, Windows Phone 8 and iOS apps – but that’s it\. If you’re like me and are stuck working on a “legacy” app such as the Windows Phone 7 game that I’ve been working on for a couple of weeks now\, then you’re largely on your own\.

If you’re in the same situation\, I would recommend that you check out the [azure\-mobile\-csharp\-sdk](https://github.com/kenegozi/azure-mobile-csharp-sdk) project by [Ken Egozi](https://github.com/kenegozi)\. It seems to do everything I need – at the moment just querying and inserting \- right off the bat\, and it looks like the Mono guys have even taken to using this code in the Mono framework\, so that’s a good sign as well\!

Great job\, Ken\!

***UPDATE \- 14 March 2013***

As good as Ken's library is\, check this out: [http://www\.johanlaanstra\.nl/?p=217](http://www.johanlaanstra.nl/?p=217)\. I've not used it yet myself\, but if I was starting from scratch I probably would\. I'd be interested to hear people's experiences with it\.
