I’ve had a couple of people ask for concrete examples of using DynaCache with frameworks other than Ninject\. The first one that I’ve put together is for Unity\.

You’ll find the Unity example in the DynaCache documentation [here](http://dynacache.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Example%20using%20Unity)\.
