I use Windows Live Writer to put together all my blog posts\, but
I also use multiple computers\. I'll sometimes find myself writing a
draft post on one computer and wanting to carry on editing it on
another\.

Live Writer stores draft posts in *Documents\\My Weblog
Posts\\Drafts*\, and in the past I've just manually copied these
draft files from one computer to another\, however it recently
occurred to me that I could use Windows Live Mesh to automate this
for me\. I'll show you how you can do it too\.

*Windows Live Mesh is part of [Windows Live Essentials 2011](http://explore.live.com/windows-live-essentials) \- you might not
have Live Mesh if you're still using an older version of
Essentials\, or you explicitly chose not to install it as part of
the latest version\.*

First\, open Windows Live Mesh\. If it's already running\, then
you'll see it's icon in the system tray \( ![image](/images/post/2011/04/Windows-Live-Writer_Using-Windows-Live-Mesh-to-synchronize-y_AAA1_image_thumb_3.png)\)\, otherwise
launch it from the Start orb/button\. Click **Sync a
folder**:

Browse to *Documents\\My Weblog Posts* and press
**Sync**\. Selecting the My Weblog Posts will
synchronize both drafts and recent post entries\.

All you have to do then is select the machines that you want to
synchronize to:

If you want\, you can even synchronize it to your SkyDrive\, but
I'm not bothering because having my draft posts backed up across 3
different computers seems like enough redundancy for me\.

Once you've set Mesh up like this\, any new posts that you create
through Live Writer will automatically be synchronized and you can
carry on working on your next big blog post from whichever machine
you end up at\.
