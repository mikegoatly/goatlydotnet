My name is Mike Goatly, husband, father and experienced full-stack software developer and architect.

I don't like to limit myself, and through the years I've been responsible for:

* Technical product ownership, working closely with stakeholders
* Leading and mentoring development teams
* Architecture and software design
* DevOps
* Frontend and backend development
* Platform modernisation
* Design and integration of machine learning models and LLMs with existing platforms
* Operational support
* Performance optimisation and troubleshooting

And sometimes all of the above at the same time, but always remaining hands-on! You can see more about this on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikegoatly/) profile.

I've worked primarily with Microsoft technologies for well over 25 years so am somewhat of
a Microsoft specialist, but I never shy away from a challenge, so my skill set is very broad.

I also write code for fun [in the open source space](https://www.github.com/mikegoatly) and a song library
management app, [Chordle](https://www.chordle.com).
