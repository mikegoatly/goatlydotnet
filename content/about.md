My name is Mike Goatly, husband, father and experienced software developer/architect/breaker. 
I've worked primarily with Microsoft technologies for well over 20 years so am somewhat of
a Microsoft specialist, though I happily dabble in other things as needed. I
[build software for fun](https://www.github.com/mikegoatly) and a Windows 10 song library
management app, [Chordle](https://www.chordle.com).

I currently work at [Coeo](http://www.coeo.com/) building our internal platforms and 
software capabilities, though any opinions expressed on this site are mine alone.
