LiveDataScript was a handy utility for Microsoft SQL Server 2005 and 2008 that allowed you to script data from a database into SQL insert statements. Features included:

* Scripting of multiple tables, a single table or selected rows from a table
* Connecting to multiple servers, allowing you to script from different server into on file
* Scripting straight to a file, to the clipboard or to a new window
* Scripting derived columns or even completely arbitrary SQL - scripts are not confined to the columns currently in a table
* Scripting with identity insertion for tables that have identity columns
